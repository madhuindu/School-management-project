The above one contains some raw data where we store it in backend.

studentsrouter.js -  where we code
In router import students data and  get raw data from router to mainpage.
get raw data by giving ID
POST - Body-parser used
DELETE - Delete operation performed
PATCH - edit data

index.js - main page
Import express,router and body-parser then we can code
